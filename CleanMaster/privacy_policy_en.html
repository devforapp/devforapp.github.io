        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><span class="app-name">CleanMaster</span> (referred to as "we") respects and protects user privacy. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information. By using this app, you agree to the practices described in this privacy policy.</p>
        
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data. This app operates entirely locally on your device and does not send any data to our servers or third-party servers.</p>
        
        <h2>Photo Library Access</h2>
        <p>To provide photo cleaning functionality, the app requires access to your photo library. All photo analysis and processing is done locally on your device. We do not upload, store, or access any photos outside of your device. Deletion operations on your photos are entirely under your control, and the app will not automatically delete any content.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>The app only stores the following information locally on your device: app preferences (such as language selection) and subscription status (managed through Apple's StoreKit). This information does not leave your device and is not shared with any third parties.</p>
        
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use Apple's StoreKit framework to handle in-app purchases and subscriptions. These transactions are handled entirely by Apple, and we cannot access your payment information. Please refer to Apple's privacy policy for more information.</p>
        
        <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>All purchases and subscriptions are processed through Apple's App Store. We do not collect or store any payment information. Subscription management is handled by Apple, and you can cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple account settings.</p>
        
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. Since we do not collect any personal data, this app is safe for users of all ages.</p>
        
        <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app. Continued use of the app indicates your acceptance of the updated privacy policy.</p>
