        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 2025</p>

        <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading, installing, or using Holy Bible (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>License Grant</h2>
        <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes in accordance with these Terms and applicable laws.</p>

        <h2>Content and Bible Translations</h2>
        <p>The App may include Bible translations that are either public domain (e.g., WEB, KJV) or licensed. You agree not to reproduce, distribute, or use any licensed translations outside the App beyond permitted personal use. Availability of translations may vary by region and licensing status.</p>

        <h2>User Content</h2>
        <p>You may create personal content such as prayers, notes, and daily devotions. You retain ownership of such content. By saving or syncing (if enabled), you grant us a limited right to process the content solely to provide App functionality (e.g., storage, sync). We do not claim ownership of your content.</p>

        <h2>Subscriptions and Billing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Some features are available via auto-renewing subscriptions processed by Apple’s App Store.</li>
            <li>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID at confirmation of purchase; subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
            <li>You can manage or cancel subscriptions in <em>Settings › Apple ID › Subscriptions</em>. Any free trial, if offered, will convert to a paid subscription unless canceled in time.</li>
            <li>Prices may vary by region. Refunds are granted only as required by applicable law.</li>
            <li>Subscriptions may remove ads and unlock premium features (e.g., multi-version access, AI devotion). Details are shown in-app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advertising</h2>
        <p>The free tier may display ads via Google AdMob. Ad personalization is controlled by Apple’s ATT and platform settings. See our Privacy Policy for details.</p>

        <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not use the App for any unlawful, abusive, or infringing activity.</li>
            <li>Do not attempt to circumvent licensing or copy protected translations.</li>
            <li>Do not misuse AI features to generate harmful, misleading, or offensive content.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="notice">
            <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>The App provides faith-based content and AI-generated devotional guidance for personal reflection. It is <strong>not</strong> a substitute for professional pastoral counseling, medical, psychological, legal, or financial advice. Content may contain variations due to translation differences and AI limitations.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use or inability to use the App.</p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App if you materially breach these Terms. You may stop using the App at any time; uninstalling the App will not automatically cancel subscriptions—please manage them via Apple settings.</p>

        <h2>Changes to the Service and Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify or discontinue features at any time and to update these Terms. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by applicable laws in your jurisdiction, without regard to conflict of law principles. You agree to resolve disputes through amicable negotiation; where unavailable, competent courts may apply.</p>
