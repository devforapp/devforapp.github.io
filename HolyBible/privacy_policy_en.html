        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Holy Bible ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights when using our mobile application.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect only the minimum information necessary to provide and improve the app:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> such as device model, operating system version, language, and app version, used for diagnostics and compatibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> anonymous usage statistics and event data to improve stability and features. We use Umeng Analytics on iOS and Android. See <a href="https://www.umeng.com/policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Umeng Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> for the free version, we integrate Google AdMob which may collect identifiers (e.g., IDFA/IDFV on iOS) and usage data to serve ads. You can opt out of personalized ads via Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt or system settings. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple ATT</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Logs:</strong> anonymized crash reports to improve reliability (system-provided diagnostics; no personal content).</li>
            <li><strong>Content You Create (Optional):</strong> private items such as prayers, notes, and daily devotions that you choose to save. By default these are stored <em>locally on your device</em> and are never transmitted. If you enable optional cloud sync in future versions, data will be transmitted and stored in encrypted form solely to provide sync functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide core features (multi-version Bible reading, search, AI devotion, prayer journaling).</li>
            <li>Maintain and improve app performance, stability, and usability.</li>
            <li>Display advertisements in the free tier (AdMob) and measure their performance.</li>
            <li>Comply with legal obligations and platform policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Processing and Storage</h2>
        <p>Core features process data <strong>on-device</strong>. Private content (prayers, notes) is stored locally by default. If cloud sync is enabled, we use industry‑standard encryption in transit and at rest. We do not sell your data.</p>

        <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> advertising network for the free tier. Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy</a>. Ad Choices: <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ads Settings</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Umeng Analytics:</strong> anonymized analytics for app usage. Policy: <a href="https://www.umeng.com/policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Umeng Privacy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple In‑App Purchases:</strong> subscriptions and purchases are processed by Apple. See <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Media Services Terms</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tracking, Identifiers, and Permissions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We request ATT consent on iOS to determine whether to show personalized ads. You can change tracking preference in <em>Settings › Privacy › Tracking</em>.</li>
            <li>The app does <strong>not</strong> collect precise location, contacts, photos, or microphone data for core reading features.</li>
            <li>If future features request additional permissions, they will be used strictly for the stated functionality and can be revoked in system settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>While the app may include faith-based content suitable for families, it is <strong>not directed to children under 13</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will promptly delete it to comply with COPPA.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Analytics and crash logs are retained only for the time necessary to analyze performance and are periodically aggregated and anonymized.</li>
            <li>Private content you create remains on your device until you delete the app data or remove the entries. For cloud sync (if enabled), you may request deletion at any time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Access, correct, or delete local content directly within the app.</li>
            <li>Opt out of personalized advertising via ATT prompt or platform settings.</li>
            <li>Request deletion of any server‑stored data (if cloud sync is enabled) by contacting us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We apply industry‑standard safeguards, encryption, and strict access controls. Data minimization is our default: most processing occurs locally on your device.</p>

        <h2>International Transfers</h2>
        <p>Third‑party providers (e.g., Google, Umeng) may process data on servers located outside your country. Where applicable, we rely on standard contractual commitments and provider policies to protect your information.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. The "Last Updated" date indicates the latest revision. Continued use of the app after updates constitutes acceptance.</p>
