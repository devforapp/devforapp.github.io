      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Last Updated: Nov 9, 2025</p>

      <p>Welcome to QrCode (the “App”). We value your privacy and data security. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share information related to you and outlines your rights. This policy applies to your use of the App on iOS devices.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We follow a “data minimization” principle and only process data necessary to provide functionality and improve user experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Permissions & Local Data</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>Camera permission: used to scan QR codes/barcodes. Scanned content is processed locally and not uploaded to our servers.</li>
            <li>Photos permission (if enabled by you): used to recognize codes from photos or save generated QR codes. Images are processed locally and not uploaded.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Usage and Diagnostic Data</strong> (via third-party analytics “Umeng Analytics SDK”): may include device identifiers (e.g., IDFV/model), OS version, app usage events (e.g., app launches, feature taps), crash logs, etc., for statistical analysis and stability improvements. This data is not used to identify you personally.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide core features (scan/recognize/generate) and ensure stability.</li>
        <li>Perform anonymized statistics to optimize experience and performance.</li>
        <li>Troubleshoot issues, improve security and reliability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>We integrate <strong>Umeng Analytics SDK</strong> for statistical analysis. It may collect the usage and diagnostic data described above. Please refer to its privacy policy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Umeng Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.umeng.com/policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.umeng.com/policy</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not upload your scanned content to third parties and do not use it for personalized advertising.</p>

      <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Local data (e.g., recognition results, generated QR images) remains on your device and is managed by you.</li>
        <li>Analytics/diagnostic data is retained by the third-party service for a reasonable period for analysis and improvements. We do not store personally identifiable information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Withdraw permissions: You can disable camera and photos permissions in iOS Settings; related features may become unavailable.</li>
        <li>Access, correction, and deletion: You can delete local history and images; contact us for assistance if needed.</li>
        <li>Disable analytics: If you wish to opt out of anonymized analytics, contact us or use in-app privacy settings in future versions (if available).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such data, please contact us to delete it.</p>

      <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to reduce the risk of data breaches, including data minimization, local processing, and encrypted transmission (where applicable). However, no system can guarantee absolute security.</p>

      <h2>8. Cross-Border Transfers</h2>
      <p>The third-party analytics service may process data on servers located within or outside your country. We require third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations.</p>

      <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy due to feature changes or regulatory updates. Material changes will be notified in the App or on the website. Your continued use signifies consent to the updated policy.</p>
